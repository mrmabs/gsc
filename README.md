Grid Squares Challenge Leaderboard

A web app to allow participants to compare activated and chased grid squares (Maidenhead Grid Squares). This is mainly intended for 50MHz+ Amateur Radio bands.

What's done so far:
* Display of overall stats
* Individual band stats
* Individual callsign stats
* Full log as debug

What needs work?
* Proper sorting
* Objects need rethinking and rewriting
* User or data input (potential security risk)
* User logins? (potential security risk)
